    <!-- OG Wingstop Story -->
    <div class="firstExplained">
      <p>Wingstop opened its first location in Garland, Texas, on July 5, 1994, bringing a bold flavor to the community. Initially operating only in the evenings, Wingstop expanded its hours in 2005 and now serves customers from 11 a.m. to midnight. The brand began franchising in 1997 and has since grown to over 1,250 locations worldwide.</p>

    <div class="founderStory">
      <p>Antonio Swad began his restaurant career at 15 as a dishwasher and first became a restaurant owner in 1986 with a carryout pizza concept. He wanted to stand out so he transitioned to the under-represented wing business. He started by offering wing samples at his pizza restaurant, he eventually established wings as a main dish, challenging the stereotype that they were merely a side or appetizer.</p>
